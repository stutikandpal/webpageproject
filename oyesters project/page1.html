			<p>A dosa is a rice pancake, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosas are a common part of the diet in South India, but has become popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with sambar and chutney.</p>
